ttsoot is a template library for DSP code. It allows to write sample based processing functions, 
but retains the flexibility of graph based processing.

The container types are based on c++0x variadic templates. 
they are using template template arguments, which are a gcc-4.5 feature. 

so... in order to compile this, you need a gcc trunk :)

the yc20 example is based on sampos faust implementation.
